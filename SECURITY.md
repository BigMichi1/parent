### Reporting Security Issues

I take security bugs seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/BigMichi1/parent/security/advisories/new) tab.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules/dependencies to the person or team maintaining the module/dependency.
